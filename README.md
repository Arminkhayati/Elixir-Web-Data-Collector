# Elixir-Web-Data-Collector

This is an elixir app I developed for collecting comments (Persian), contents, user info, movie info and artists info 
from one the most popular movie rating and downloading websites (Dibamovies.com) in Iran and save them in a postgresql database using Ecto.</br>
Unfortunately this website got down by government but with a little modifying it can be used on Valamovies.com , diba movie successor, website.</br>
I used this collected data for my free time nlp project. If you too want this dataset just contact me.</br>
**If you can and want to help me to annotate and labelling this huge dataset of persian movie comments for sentiment analysis don't hesitate to contact me.***</br>
